# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1. Update SecurityGroup to restrict access to Instance (only open to specific IP, CIDR for port 22) or to remove inbound rule that allows traffic to port 22
2. Associate the new NACL to the public subnet in the VPC to DENY any traffic to port 22.
3. Disable SSH password login on the application server instance.



# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

2. Update IAM policy so that Instances can only Get from free recipe bucket.
3. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 and Add a bucket policy that allows access from the VPC endpoint.
