# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Use AWS Shield and AWS WAF


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Yes, absolutely. You can create VPC private Endpoint in VPC and create S3 bucket Policy to give the endpoint access permission.
By doing this, the instances outside the VPC cannot connect to bucket.


# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, applying default encryption does not effect existing objects.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Sorry, I dont think I really understand the question. Are you asking about overriding the CF stack?
If you create a change set for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. 
Use change sets to understand which resources CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack.
