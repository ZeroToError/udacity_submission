# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
1. UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce -> High: the source instance
2. UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce -> Low: the target instance



# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following Data sources: 
VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event logs, EKS audit logs, and DNS logs. 

In this case the source of BruteForce attack may come from VPC Flow Logs

GuardDuty analyzes the VPC Flow Logs data. It consumes VPC Flow Log events directly from the VPC Flow Logs feature through an independent and duplicative stream of flow logs. 
It then detects the abnormal IP traffic going to and from network interfaces within the environment.
