Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.2.0
1. Add rules to restrict accesss to port 22, only allow from specific IP, CIDR blocks.
2. Add rules to restrict accesss to port 3389, only allow from specific IP, CIDR blocks.


Noncompliant Rules
1. Enable server-side encryption on cand-c3-free-recipes and cand-c3-secret-recipes buckets
2. The rule fails if a NACL inbound entry allows a source CIDR block of '0.0.0.0/0' or '::/0' for ports 22 or 3389 -> update to different CIDR block 0.0.0.0/0
3. Encrypt EBS volumes with a KMS key.


Inspector
1. Disable password authentication over SSH
