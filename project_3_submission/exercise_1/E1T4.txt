Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The SecurityGroup does not configured properly
Port 22 is open to all IPs, makes the system vulnerable to bruteforce attack.


# Poor practice 2
The S3 buckets should
	- Enable versioning
	- Use VPC Endpoints -> This allows to block requests that do not originate from trusted VPC network
